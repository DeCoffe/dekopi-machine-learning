## Introduction

In this project, the machine learning team will develop a model capable of classifying coffee leaf diseases. The model is designed using convolutional neural networks (CNN) to accurately identify common diseases affecting Ethiopian coffee plants. The purpose of this model is to assist farmers in quickly detecting and diagnosing leaf diseases to improve crop health and yield.


## Features

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Model building and training in Jupyter Notebooks
- Model evaluation and metrics calculation
- Saving and loading trained models
- Export Model to TFJS

## Datasets

The dataset consists of 4 classes representing 3 types of common coffee leaf diseases (Cercospora, Leaf Rust, Phoma) and healthy leaves, with a total of [jumlah gambar] images. The images were collected from public sources and augmented to increase the amount of data for training and validation. We focused on the most prevalent leaf diseases affecting Ethiopian coffee plants.
